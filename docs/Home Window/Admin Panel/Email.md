Email Settings
=

The Email Settings section of your application allows users to configure the parameters required for sending emails. This feature is essential for sending notifications, alerts, and communication within your application. Here's a breakdown of each component:

**SMTP Configuration**
-

In this section, you can configure the email settings to send your test report via email.

1. **SMTP Port:**\
The SMTP Port is the port number used for outgoing email server communication. It specifies the channel through which your application connects to an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. The default SMTP port for secure connections is 465, while for non-secure connections, it's often 25. However, the specific port may vary based on your email service provider's requirements.
1. **Hostname (SMTP Server):**\
The Hostname, or SMTP Server, is the address of the email server used to send emails. This server address varies depending on your email service provider. For example, Gmail's SMTP server is "smtp.gmail.com."
1. **Authentication Method:**\
The Authentication Method determines how your application verifies the sender's identity with the email server. Common authentication methods include "Username and Password" and "OAuth 2.0" for secure and authorized email transmission.
1. **Connection Type:**\
The Connection Type specifies the security protocol used to encrypt the communication between your application and the email server. Options usually include "None" (for no encryption), "SSL/TLS" (for secure encryption), or "STARTTLS" (for opportunistic encryption). The choice depends on your email service provider's security settings.
1. **Username and Password:**\
The Username and Password fields are used for user authentication when connecting to the SMTP server. The "Username" is typically the sender's email address. The "Password" is a secret key known only to the sender, serving as a secure means of verification.

**Configuring Email Settings:**\
To set up your email configuration, you'll need to obtain the SMTP Port, Hostname, and Connection Type from your email service provider. Specify the Authentication Method as "Username and Password" if required. Enter the appropriate Username and Password to establish a secure connection. Ensure that all details are accurate to enable seamless email communication. By configuring the Email Settings in your application, users can send and receive emails, thereby enhancing communication and engagement within the platform.

The recipient list is a fundamental feature in our email application, designed to simplify and streamline the process of addressing your emails. With this feature, managing and selecting recipients for your messages has never been easier.

Email Properties

The "Email Properties" feature in our application allows you to fine-tune and customize your outgoing email messages. These properties enable you to add a personal touch, enhance the professionalism of your emails, and ensure that they meet your unique communication needs. Here's a breakdown of the key email properties you can configure:

**Subject Line**
-

The subject line is your email's headline and the first thing recipients see. Make your subject line clear and engaging to capture the recipient's attention.

**From Name and Email**
-

Specify the sender's name and email address, ensuring it reflects your identity or organization. This adds a personal touch and helps recipients recognize the sender.

**Importance and Priority**
-

Indicate the importance or priority level of your email with options such as "High," "Normal," or "Low." This helps recipients understand the urgency of your message.

**Delivery and Read Receipts**
-

Request delivery and read receipts to be notified when your email is delivered and read. This is useful for tracking the status of important messages.

**Attachments**
-

Add attachments to your email, such as documents, images, or files. Ensure your attachments are relevant to the content of your message.

**Signature**
-

Create and manage email signatures to provide contact information and a professional closing statement. Signatures add a personal touch to your emails and can include your name, title, company, and contact details.

**CC (Carbon Copy) and BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)**
-

CC allows you to send a copy of the email to additional recipients who are visible to all other recipients. BCC allows you to send a copy to additional recipients without others seeing their email addresses.

**Custom Headers**
-

Add custom headers to your email, which can be used for various purposes, such as tracking or categorization.

**Template Selection**
-

Choose email templates to maintain consistency in your email designs and content, ensuring a professional look and feel.

**How to Use Email Properties:**\
Access the email properties section when composing a new email. Customize the subject, sender information, delivery options, and any other desired properties. Review and save your changes before sending the email. Customizing email properties ensures that your emails are not only well-crafted but also tailored to your specific communication requirements.
